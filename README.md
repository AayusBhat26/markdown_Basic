This project is a **Markdown Previewer** that allows users to write and preview Markdown text in real time. It includes features for managing multiple pages, exporting the content as HTML, and generating a GitHub README.

## Features

- **Live Markdown Editing:** 
  A text area allows users to input Markdown syntax, and a preview pane displays the formatted output in real time.
  
- **Responsive Layout:** 
  The editor and previewer are arranged side-by-side on larger screens and stacked vertically on smaller screens for mobile responsiveness.
  
- **Multiple Pages Management:** 
  A sidebar enables users to create, edit, and delete multiple pages, making it easier to manage different Markdown files in one app.

- **Clear Button:** 
  A button to reset the Markdown editor back to its default empty state.

- **Download as HTML:** 
  A button that allows users to download their Markdown input as an HTML file.
